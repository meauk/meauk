            <h2>Being An Former Revert Again</h2>
            <h3>A Primary Reason: The Prophethood of Muhammad</h3>
            <p>I got to know that I turned away from the Islaam when I noticed the fact that I can no longer believe that Muhammad is a prophet. The reason for this, in my view, is that he was a merchant until the age of 40, which makes me suspect—at least personally—that he heard about local Judaism and Christianity from others and then reconstructed those ideas in his own mind.</p>
            <h3>Two Secondary Reasons</h3>
            <p>In addition, I have two more reasons.</p>
            <h4>Unconditional Obedientness Seen in Sunnah</h4>
            <p>One is that the Sunnah requires unconditional obedience, where the Sunnah is the words and actions of Muhammad himself after his recogition as a prophet, that have been passed down through the chain of transmission (Isnaad) from him. This bothers me, as it makes me feel like the term and concept of the Sunnah is merely an excuse to justify following Muhammad. Of course, I know Sunnah is believed to be a half part of the Waḥyayn, i.e. the revelations to him and to be mentioned indirectly in the Qurʾaan for the purpose of being followed.</p>
            <h4>Pluralistic Dependency Seen in Tahleel</h4>
            <p>The other is the first half of the Shahada (the declaration of faith)—specifically, "Laa ʾilaaha ʾillallaah" ("There is none worthy of worship except Allah"), the statement in Tahleel—which I see as dependent on other faiths. In other words, I feel that if it were truly a monotheistic faith, it should be expressible in a self-contained way as its monotheistic nature, without any reference to other faiths (in this context, particularly beliefs or ideologies that involve multiple objects of worship).</p>
