Question:
Why did you come back to the Islam?

Answer:
Simply speaking, Allah has guided me. Alhamdulillah

The details are below.

As a premise, I have always believed the existence of Allah since seven years ago. What has changed was what I have said or not said of Allah. I always have felt to be right at the moment when I said something and when I didn't say something, but, of course, I know now that I told a lie on Allah since quitting being a Muslim until reverting to the Islam.

Between 2016 and 2022, sometimes Christians came to me, and they almost inspired me that their Christian teachings are correct.

I don't know whether I got such an impact on me inconsciously or not, but one video (which I myself intentionally began to watch and whose theme was not of religion/faith) was clearly a trigger for me to regard myself as a Christian on September 17, 2022.

I think this was an opportunity to re-think about the Islam even from its outside, in the other words, it was time necessary for me to become a Muslim with the faith stronger than before.

Anyway, on those days, I came to need to reason what I believed for establishing my own faith in my heart more.

However, my mind changed alone against my intention at last. I got lost between Christianity and the Islam, which was what I noticed later. Because of this process, I began calling myself a Theist. At this time, I was no longer a Christian.

As a Theist, I still believed the existence of Allah but without a specific theology. I came to see both Christianity and the Islam from their own outside, and I found what is the most different and found that it can be applied to all the religions other than the Islam.

All the religions including Christianity but except the Islam are based on the relative conflict between Orthodox and Heresy. However, only the Islam is based on the absolute conflict between Pure/Original and Unpure/Unoriginal.

After I learned this, Allah perfectly removed some hesitation from my heart, and I reverted to the Islam by taking my shahadah with my intention.
